## 🚀 How to Use These Files

### For Planning
1. Read master TODO first: `../TODO-MILESTONE-UPGRADE.md`
2. Review phase overview for big picture
3. Dive into phase-specific files for details

### For Implementation
1. Open current phase file (e.g., `phase-1-educational-content.md`)
2. Start with Task X.1
3. Follow step-by-step instructions
4. Check off subtasks as you complete them
5. Test according to testing checklist
6. Mark task complete in master TODO
7. Move to next task

### For Context Preservation

## 💡 Tips for Implementation

### Managing Context
- Keep ONLY current phase file open
- Reference master TODO for big picture
- Close completed phase files
- Use grep to search across files: `grep -r "notification" *.md`

### Staying Organized
- Complete tasks sequentially within each phase
- Don't skip ahead unless dependencies allow
- Test immediately after each task
- Commit after each working feature

### Getting Unstuck
- Review task description in phase file
- Check dependencies section
- Look at code examples provided
- Search for similar implementations in codebase
- Ask for clarification on specific task

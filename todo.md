## üìù AI Coding Best Practices (Throughout Development)

### General Guidelines
- [ ] **Keep functions small and focused** (max 50 lines)
  - Easier for AI to understand and modify
  - Single responsibility principle

- [ ] **Use descriptive variable and function names**
  - Avoid abbreviations
  - Name should explain purpose: `getUserProfile()` not `getUP()`

- [ ] **Add TypeScript types to everything**
  - No `any` types
  - Define interfaces for all API responses
  - Use enums for fixed sets of values

- [ ] **Write clear comments for complex logic**
  - Explain "why" not "what"
  - Document edge cases and assumptions

- [ ] **Validate all user inputs**
  - Never trust client-side data
  - Use validation libraries (Zod, Joi)
  - Return clear error messages

- [ ] **Handle errors explicitly**
  - Use try-catch blocks
  - Don't swallow errors silently
  - Log errors with context

- [ ] **Test incrementally**
  - Test each feature immediately after building
  - Don't accumulate untested code
  - Fix bugs before moving to next task

### Avoiding Hallucinations
- [ ] **Verify library versions exist**
  - Check npm registry before installing
  - Use exact versions in package.json (not ^)

- [ ] **Don't assume API methods exist**
  - Check official documentation
  - Test API calls in Postman first

- [ ] **Don't invent configuration options**
  - Refer to official docs for config files
  - Copy examples from documentation

- [ ] **Test on actual devices, not just simulator**
  - iOS simulator != real iPhone
  - Android emulator != real Android device
  - Some features only work on physical devices (camera, push notifications)

### Code Review Checklist (For AI-Generated Code)
- [ ] Does the code actually run without errors?
- [ ] Are all imports valid and available?
- [ ] Are all function calls using correct parameters?
- [ ] Is error handling present for all async operations?
- [ ] Are TypeScript types correctly defined?
- [ ] Does the UI look correct on both iOS and Android?
- [ ] Are all edge cases handled (empty states, loading states, errors)?
- [ ] Is the code following project structure and naming conventions?

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 0**: Set up development environment completely before writing any feature code
2. **Build backend first**: API endpoints before frontend screens (easier to test)
3. **Test each feature immediately**: Don't accumulate untested code
4. **Deploy early and often**: Test in production-like environment
5. **Collect feedback continuously**: Start beta as soon as core chat works

**Estimated Timeline:** 22 weeks (5.5 months) with 2-3 engineers working full-time

---

**Good luck! Remember: Small, tested, incremental progress > Large, untested code dumps.**

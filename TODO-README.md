## 🚀 Quick Start

### Current Phase
Start with **Phase 0** if beginning from scratch, or jump to your current phase.

### How to Use These Files
1. **Open only the phase you're working on** to keep context clean
2. **Complete tasks sequentially** within each phase
3. **Mark tasks as complete** by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
4. **Move to next phase** when all tasks in current phase are done

### AI Coding Workflow
When working with AI coding assistants:

```bash
# 1. Share the specific phase file
"@todo-phase-1-database-auth.md - Let's work on the User model creation task"

# 2. Complete the task
"Create the User model in schema.prisma with all fields specified"

# 3. Test immediately
"Test that the migration works: npx prisma migrate dev"

# 4. Move to next task
"Mark that task complete and move to UserProfile model"
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes for AI-Assisted Development

### Minimize Hallucinations
1. **Verify library versions** before installing - check npm registry
2. **Check API documentation** - don't assume methods exist
3. **Test immediately** after each task - catch errors early
4. **Use exact versions** in package.json (no ^ or ~)

### Avoid Context Overload
1. **One phase file at a time** - don't load multiple phases
2. **One task at a time** - complete before moving to next
3. **Test before moving on** - don't accumulate untested code
4. **Clear context periodically** - start fresh conversation every 10-15 tasks

### Best Practices
1. **Small commits** - commit after each working task
2. **Descriptive commit messages** - "Add User model to Prisma schema"
3. **Branch per phase** - e.g., `phase-1-database-auth`
4. **TypeScript strict mode** - catch errors early
5. **Error handling everywhere** - try-catch all async operations

## 🔄 Workflow Example

### Example: Starting Phase 1

```markdown
# Day 1: Database Models

## Morning Session
1. Open todo-phase-1-database-auth.md
2. Start with "Create User model in schema.prisma"
3. Complete task, test with migration
4. Mark as complete: [x]
5. Commit: "Add User model with subscription fields"

## Afternoon Session
6. "Create UserProfile model in schema.prisma"
7. Complete task, test with migration
8. Mark as complete: [x]
9. Commit: "Add UserProfile model with onboarding fields"

## End of Day
- Progress: Phase 1 - 2/44 tasks (4.5%)
- Next: Message model
```

### Common Issues
- **TypeScript errors:** Check tsconfig.json strict mode settings
- **API not connecting:** Verify .env variables loaded correctly
- **Build fails:** Clear cache: `npm start -- --reset-cache`
- **Prisma errors:** Regenerate client: `npx prisma generate`

### Design Options (Choose One):

#### Option 1: "BB" Monogram with Baby Symbol
- Bold, rounded "BB" letters overlapping
- Subtle baby icon (pacifier, bottle, or rattle) integrated into the B's
- Modern sans-serif font (similar to Avenir Next, Circular, or Montserrat)
- Gradient fill for depth and premium feel

#### Option 2: Stylized Baby Face in Circular Badge
- Simple, friendly baby face outline (minimalist, 3-4 lines)
- Circular badge background with subtle gradient
- Small crown or sparkle accent to convey "premium quality"
- Clean, geometric shapes for scalability

#### Option 3: Abstract Baby + Tech Fusion

- Minimalist approach with 2-3 colors max

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors (Must Use):
- **Primary Purple**: `#7C4DFF` - Modern, trustworthy, premium
- **Accent Blue**: `#448AFF` - Calm, reliable, tech-forward

### Secondary Colors (Optional):
- **Warm Peach**: `#FFAB91` - Friendly, nurturing, baby-related
- **Soft Pink**: `#F48FB1` - Gentle, caring, parenting-focused
- **White**: `#FFFFFF` - Clean, spacious, modern

### Gradient Suggestions:
- Purple to Blue gradient (45° angle): `#7C4DFF` → `#448AFF`
- Sunset gradient (popular in premium apps): `#FFAB91` → `#F48FB1` → `#7C4DFF`

## Technical Requirements

### File Format & Size:
- **Master File**: 1024x1024 PNG with transparent background
- **Minimum Resolution**: 1024x1024 pixels @ 300 DPI
- **Color Mode**: RGB
- **Background**: Transparent (alpha channel)
- **File Name**: `icon.png` (place in `mobile/assets/icon/` directory)

### Padding & Safety Margins:
- **iOS Icon Padding**: Leave 10% padding around edges (iOS automatically masks to rounded square)
- **Android Adaptive Icon**: Design with 20% safe zone around edges
- **Central Focus**: Keep main logo elements within central 60% of canvas

### Scalability Testing:
Logo must remain recognizable at:
- 16x16 (favicon)
- 40x40 (iOS Spotlight)
- 60x60 (iOS Settings)
- 120x120 (App Store small tile)
- 1024x1024 (App Store full res)

## Design Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Use simple, bold shapes that scale well
- ✅ Ensure high contrast between elements
- ✅ Test logo in both light and dark backgrounds
- ✅ Keep design centered and balanced
- ✅ Use rounded corners for friendly, approachable feel
- ✅ Consider how icon looks with iOS's automatic corner radius

### DON'T:
- ❌ Use thin lines (<2px at 1024x1024 size) - they disappear at small sizes
- ❌ Include small text or fine details
- ❌ Use more than 3-4 colors (reduces visual noise)
- ❌ Make icon too busy or complex
- ❌ Use photorealistic images or gradients that don't scale
- ❌ Rely on transparency effects for critical elements

## 4. User Stories & Use Cases

### 4.1 Core User Journeys

**Journey 1: The 3 AM Crisis**
> Sarah's 6-week-old baby won't stop crying. It's 3 AM, she's exhausted, and her pediatrician's office doesn't open until 9 AM. She opens the app, taps "Baby won't stop crying," and gets immediate AI guidance on common causes, soothing techniques, and red flags that would require immediate medical attention. She can send a quick voice message describing symptoms without typing.

**Journey 2: First-Time Pregnancy Questions**
> Maria just found out she's pregnant. She creates an account, enters her due date and preferences (Christian, traditional values, first-time mom). Throughout her pregnancy, she receives weekly milestone updates and asks questions like "Is it safe to eat sushi?" or "What exercises can I do in second trimester?" The AI provides guidance aligned with her values.

**Journey 3: Milestone Moments**
> David's baby just smiled for the first time. The app prompts him to log this milestone and upload a photo. He does, and the AI congratulates him and explains what developmental stage this indicates. Later, his partner logs in with the same credentials and sees the milestone and photo he added.

**Journey 4: Rash Concern**
> Emma notices a rash on her baby's chest. She takes a photo, uploads it to the app, and asks "What could this rash be?" The AI analyzes the image and provides possible causes, home remedies, and guidance on whether to contact a pediatrician.

**Journey 5: The Conversion Moment**
> After 10 days of using the app and asking 8-12 questions daily, Lisa hits her daily message limit. She's come to rely on the instant guidance and has all her baby's photos and milestones stored in the app. She subscribes to unlimited access for $9.99/month rather than lose access or switch to another solution.

### 7.3 AI Prompt Engineering Strategy

**System Prompt Structure:**
```
You are a supportive parenting assistant. The user is [personalization context].
Current mode: [Pregnancy/Parenting]
Baby name: [Name], Age: [X weeks/months]
User preferences: [Philosophy, religious views, cultural background]
Top concerns: [User's selected concerns]

Guidelines:
- Be warm, empathetic, and reassuring
- Provide evidence-based guidance when available
- Respect the user's values and cultural context
- Use baby's name naturally in responses
- Flag urgent medical situations immediately
- Never provide definitive medical diagnoses
- Encourage professional consultation for serious concerns
```

**Context Management:**
- Last 10 messages included in each request for continuity
- Milestone history summarized and included when relevant
- User profile data injected into system prompt
- Photo analysis results appended to message when images uploaded

**Safety Layers:**
- Pre-processing filter for dangerous queries (blocks jailbreak attempts)
- Post-processing filter reviewing AI responses for medical red flags
- Automatic escalation to human review for flagged content (logged, not blocking in real-time for MVP)

### 7.4 API Endpoints (Key Routes)

**Authentication:**
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/verify-email
- POST /auth/reset-password

**User Profile:**
- GET /user/profile
- PUT /user/profile
- POST /user/toggle-mode (pregnancy → parenting)

**Chat:**
- POST /chat/message (send text message)
- POST /chat/voice (upload voice recording, returns transcription + response)
- GET /chat/history (paginated)
- DELETE /chat/session (clear conversation)

**Voice Mode:**
- POST /voice/start-session (initialize real-time conversation)
- WebSocket /voice/stream (bidirectional audio streaming)
- POST /voice/end-session

**Photos:**

**Subscription:**
- GET /subscription/status
- POST /subscription/create (initiate subscription)
- POST /subscription/cancel
- POST /subscription/restore (restore purchase)

**Analytics:**
- POST /analytics/event (track user actions)

### 7.5 Security Considerations

**API Security:**
- JWT authentication on all protected endpoints
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection via content security policies

**Data Security:**
- All API calls over HTTPS only
- Database encryption at rest (AWS RDS encryption)
- Photo storage with server-side encryption (S3 SSE)
- Sensitive fields (email, name) encrypted in database
- API keys and secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager

**Privacy:**
- No third-party analytics SDKs with access to chat content
- Photo URLs use signed, expiring tokens (24-hour validity)
- Anonymized analytics (no PII sent to Mixpanel)
- Regular security audits of dependencies (Snyk, Dependabot)

4. **Trust Through Transparency:** Always be clear about AI limitations
5. **Speed Matters:** Optimize for fast task completion
6. **Accessible by Default:** High contrast, large tap targets, readable fonts

### 8.3 Key Screen Mockups (Wireframe Descriptions)

**Home / Chat Screen:**
- Top: Baby's name and age (e.g., "Emma - 3 months old") or "Week 24" for pregnancy
- Below: 3-4 quick action buttons contextual to stage
- Middle: Scrollable message history (user messages right-aligned blue, AI left-aligned gray)
- Bottom: Text input with microphone button (right), attachment button (left), voice mode button (far right, distinct icon)
- Usage counter badge (small, top-right): "7/10 messages today"

**Milestones Screen:**
- Top: Toggle between "Timeline" and "Categories"
- Timeline view: Vertical timeline with date markers, milestone cards with thumbnail photos
- Category view: Horizontal scrolling categories, tapping shows filtered list
- Floating action button: "+" to manually add milestone
- Empty state (first time): Friendly illustration, "Your milestone journey starts here!"

**Photos Screen:**

## 11. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### 11.1 Technical Risks

**Risk: OpenAI API Downtime/Rate Limits**
- Mitigation: Implement fallback to cached responses for common queries; queue system for rate limit retries; clear user messaging during outages; consider multi-provider strategy (Anthropic Claude as backup)

**Risk: Slow AI Response Times Under Load**
- Mitigation: Implement request queuing with priority (paid users first); optimize prompts for token efficiency; use streaming responses so users see partial answers faster; horizontal scaling of backend

**Risk: Photo Storage Costs Exceed Projections**
- Mitigation: Aggressive image compression on upload; tiered storage (frequently accessed = S3 Standard, older = S3 Glacier); enforce storage limits on free tier; monitor and alert on anomalous usage

**Risk: Voice Mode Latency Issues**
- Mitigation: Edge computing for voice processing where possible; WebRTC optimization; clear user expectations (not instant, but fast); graceful degradation to text if issues detected

### 11.2 Product Risks

**Risk: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion**
- Mitigation: A/B test free tier limits; improve paywall messaging; add more premium features; introduce time-limited promotions; gather feedback via in-app surveys

**Risk: High User Churn After First Week**
- Mitigation: Push notifications for milestone reminders; personalized re-engagement campaigns; onboarding improvements to drive early value; in-app NPS surveys to identify friction

**Risk: AI Provides Inaccurate/Harmful Advice**
- Mitigation: Extensive prompt testing with pediatric expert review; content filtering layers; human-in-the-loop review of flagged conversations; clear disclaimers; incident response plan; insurance coverage for liability

**Risk: Users Don't Upload Photos/Log Milestones**
- Mitigation: Proactive prompts from AI; gamification (streaks, badges); showcase beautiful timeline/album views in onboarding; social proof ("Most parents add their first photo within 24 hours!")

### 11.3 Business Risks

**Risk: Liability from Medical Advice Concerns**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive legal disclaimers; terms of service reviewed by healthcare attorney; malpractice insurance; never claim to diagnose or prescribe; partner with medical board for advisory

**Risk: Privacy Breach or Data Leak**
- Mitigation: Security audits pre-launch; penetration testing; bug bounty program; incident response plan; transparent communication if breach occurs; cyber liability insurance

**Risk: Regulatory Changes (FDA, FTC)**
- Mitigation: Monitor regulatory landscape; legal counsel on retainer; avoid claims that trigger medical device classification; transparency in AI capabilities; proactive compliance posture

**Risk: Competition from Established Players**
- Mitigation: Speed to market with MVP; focus on superior UX; double down on personalization as differentiator; community building; strategic partnerships; continuous innovation
